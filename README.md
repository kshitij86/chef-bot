# chef-bot

This script takes a user's credentials, and the problem-code, opens a browser and logs in and displays the solution to the required problem. 
Now, logging in to view a successful submission may seem gratuitous, but this project was (and probably still is) meant to solve the user's
unsolved problems, until they stop the script. However due to missing plaintext code in the editor and motivation (**maybe both**) it currently works as a simple script to open a webpage.
**Future relases may see this project do what it was meant to.**

###### Note : As this project comprises only of the script, Selenium webdriver must to be installed. No ~~venv~~ was used, no ~~dependencies placed~~.
